# gene2protein: Gene-Protein Relationship Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of biological data, specifically looking at the relationship between gene expression levels and protein abundance. The goal is to understand how gene expression levels correlate with protein production in cells, and to build a predictive model for protein expression based on gene expression data.

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

- `gene_expression_analysis.py`: This script performs initial data loading, processing, and analysis to explore the correlation between gene expression and protein abundance.
- `linear_regression_model.py`: This script uses linear regression to predict protein expression levels based on gene expression data.

## Requirements

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- pandas: A library for data manipulation and analysis
- scikit-learn: A machine learning library for Python

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
